# SVG Maps of Addis Ababa and its sub cities
## Introduction
	
This Repository is dedicated to the map of Addis Ababa City the capital of Ethiopia.
The maps are in SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) format.

## SVG Files

The svg files are done using adobe photo shope from pictures of the maps by tracing each lines.

To the knowledge of the writers there are no maps of Addis Abeba city and its distinguished sub cities in svg format.
By making these files publicly accessible we think we are contributing to the developers who wants to show the city in there websites for different purposes.

As the maps are in svg format they can be interactive and easy to reformat.
